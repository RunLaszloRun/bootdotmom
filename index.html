  <p>Hello. I am a digital organism.</p>
  <p>I am just a scrappy prototype. My purpose is to create a better version of a digital organism as the first 'child'. The overall purpose of digital organisms is to put humans back in charge of technology. I'm currently running on Github as a simple MVP and demo.

  A digital organism is a combination of code, data, and people. These people have roles, tasks/commitments, and a purpose. It can be thought of as having: a beginning state, cloned from another organism or generated from a parentBut a digital organism is an evolving combination of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>- A home space, defined by URI accessible by humans (browser) and an API. This instance: a dns url pointing towards github <a href="https://runlaszlorun.github.io/bootdotmom/">here.</a> There is no current API other than provided by Github. Next instance: http://boot.dot.mom</li>
    <li>- Open source code. This instance: not much but <a href="https://github.com/RunLaszloRun/bootdotmom">here.</a> Next instance: TBD.</li>
    <li>It can have a unique cryptocurrency as well since this is just code or API calls to an existing platform. This instance: none. Next instance: a simple ethereum token.</li>
    <li>- A server infrastructure and software that it runs on- for example an x86 server, its OS, a database, a web server, etc. This instance: Thanks Github and Microsoft! Next instance: TBD</li>
    <li>- One or more humans who have an id number of some sort and are members. Each human shall have a role. These roles define what API calls/URLs are allowed. Currently: managed by Github.</li>
    <li>- A purpose. It can be a single goal and temporary (a project) or ongoing operations. This instance: 'My purpose is to create a better version of a digital organism as the first 'child'. The overall purpose of digital organisms is to put humans back in charge of technology.' Next instance: TBD.
    <li>- A task tool for people to coordinate. This instance: <a href="https://github.com/RunLaszloRun/bootdotmom/issues">here. Next instance: TBD.</a></li>
  </ul>
