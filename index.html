  <p>Hello. I am a digital organism.</p>

  <p>I'm actually just a scrappy prototype leveraging Github. My purpose is to create a better version of a digital organism as the first 'child'. The overall purpose of digital organisms is to put humans back in charge of technology. I'm just a simple MVP and demo.</p>

  <p>A digital organism is a combination of code, other data, and people. These people have roles, tasks/commitments, and a purpose. It can be thought of as having: a beginning state, cloned from another organism or generated from a parent and living in code and data; its purpose, a desired goal or end state of code and data; and a project or ongoing operations executed by people to get it there.</p>

  <p>More specifically, it is an evolving combination of the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>- A home space, defined by URI accessible by humans (browser). Under this home URI are web pages, actions called by a REST API, and JSON data also called by REST. This instance: a dns url pointing towards github <a href="https://runlaszlorun.github.io/bootdotmom/">here.</a> Some simple machine-readable data is <a href="https://runlaszlorun.github.io/bootdotmom/index.json">here.</a>There is no current API other than provided by Github. Next instance: http://boot.dot.mom</li>
    <li>- Open source code. This instance: not much but <a href="https://github.com/RunLaszloRun/bootdotmom">here.</a> Next instance: TBD.</li>
    <li>- It can have a unique cryptocurrency as well since this is just code or API calls to an existing platform. This instance: none. Next instance: a simple ethereum token.</li>
    <li>- An instantiated server infrastructure and software that it runs on- for example an x86 server, its OS, a database, a web server, etc. This instance: Thanks Github and Microsoft! Next instance: TBD</li>
    <li>- One or more humans who have an id number of some sort and are members. Each human shall have a role. These roles define what API calls/URLs are allowed. Currently: managed by Github.</li>
    <li>- A purpose. It can be a single goal and temporary (a project) or ongoing operations. This instance: 'My purpose is to create a better version of a digital organism as the first 'child'. The overall purpose of digital organisms is to put humans back in charge of technology.' Next instance: TBD.
    <li>- A task tool for people to coordinate. This instance: <a href="https://github.com/RunLaszloRun/bootdotmom/issues">here.</a> Next instance: TBD.</li>
    <li>- Probably a list of any transactions which change state. This instance: Github commits and Issue status changes.
  </ul>

  <p> A digital organism's lifecycle is defined by  the following core capabilities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>- Generate: a human processto create the initial human purpose and project and a process (preferably executable code) to create a child instance or clone the current one. There is currently no method to generate a child but this is the purpose if this boot instance. Cloning exists per Github.</li>
    <li>- Operate: Under this heading are the APIs that the organism has once generated. Currently only those of Github.</li>
    <li>- Destroy: Rules for its termination. This can be event driven and automatic, time expiration, or human initiated.</li>

<p>Welcome to cyberspace. The real world is becoming a glorious clusterf***, so make sure to have fun!<p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
    bootdotmom and team
